<h1>Switch from PHP to Python programming: a summary</h1>

<p>Assume you're familiar with PHP and want to explore Python, this document discusses about PHP code and their equivalence code in Python</p>

<p>The purpose is to give a sense of how a migration of Python programming language.</p>

<p>The chosen version for demontration code is 5.3+ for PHP and 3.4+ for Python. There are differences with other versions, but the main dicussion focuses on language / framework philosophy.</p>

<p>Without speicial notes, all sample code are written in pair. First is PHP version and the second is Python version.</p>

<h2>Open tag</h2>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;h1&gt;Hello world&lt;/h1&gt;
From: &lt;?php echo gethostname(); ?&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="python">#!/usr/bin/env python
import socket
print(
    "Content-Type: text/html\n\n",
    "&lt;h1&gt;Hello world&lt;/h1&gt;",
    socket.gethostname()
)
</code></pre>

<p>These are supposed to be run using php-cgi and python using CGI behind a webserver.</p>

<p>PHP is itself a template script orginally used to embed server-side logic in HTML. Open tag is used to separated PHP code from others.</p>

<p>Python is a genaral-purpose language. To serve for web devlopement, we must understand HTTP protocol to produce a page. In production, Python run itself as a webserver.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>There is nothing like php.ini in Python to configure runtime.</p>

<p>However, for development we should notice two files:</p>

<ul>
<li>~/.pythonrc for interactive session.</li>
<li>~/.pdbrc for built-in debugger.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Library and extension</h2>

<p>Library in PHP are pure PHP code, often installed via Composer or drop in.
Extension in PHP are compiled and configured in php.ini
Isolating extensions with specific version per project is not possible.</p>

<p>Library in Python has both form (pure and compiled), managed via easy_install or newer "pip" package manager. Python can have many different set of libraries with specific version separated per project via virtualenv.</p>

<h2>Array</h2>

<pre><code class="php">$places = array('Tokyo', 'Nagoya', 'Osaka');
printf("Total: %d\n", count($places));
places[] = 'Yokohama';
for ($i = 0; $i &lt; count($places); $i++) {
    printf("%d %s\n", $i + 1, $places[$i]);
}
echo implode(' -&gt; ', $places);
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="python">places = ['Tokyo', 'Nagoya', 'Osaka']
print("Total: %d" % len(places))
places.append('Yokohama')
for i, place in enumerate(places, 1):
    print("{} {}".format(i, place))
print(' -&gt; '.join(places));
</code></pre>

<p>There is two ways of representing array in Python. 
First is "tuple", immutable array using parenthesis ( ) to denote. It's memory-efficient, therefore we cannot add or remove items in places.
Sencond is "list", mutable array using [ ] to denote. Support various operation as we expected in OOP style, sure. Everything's fully OOP. And ' -> ' in Python is a string object!</p>

<h2>Map</h2>

<pre><code class="php">$classified = array(
    'good' =&gt; 30,
    'average' =&gt; 50,
    'bad' =&gt; 20,
);
echo isset($classified['total']) ? $classified['total'] : 0;
foreach ($classified as $type =&gt; $n) {
    echo "$type : $n\n";
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="python">classified = {
    'good': 30,
    'average': 50,
    'bad': 20,
}
print(classified.get('total', 0))
for type, n in classified.items():
    print(type + ' : ' + n)
</code></pre>

<p>PHP has array and associated array and we're unable to distinguish them.
Python has its own thing called dictionary. dict has very important role in Python and we will gradually explore it.</p>

<p>One important characteristic is list comprehension.</p>

<p>See PHP:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$squares = array();
foreach (range(0, 10) as $i) {
    $squares[] = $i*$i;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And Python way (It's more powerful than a shorcut):</p>

<pre><code class="python">squares = [i**2 for i in range(10)]
</code></pre>

<p>There are many good built-in classes available in "collections". Refer the Python manual for more information.</p>

<h2>Error handling</h2>

<p>PHP uses configuration to control notice, warn, error, ... for internal error. 
No way to catch these, specially "fatal error". It may works but it's silent about what's wrong.</p>

<p>Python uses exception for everything, even interally. It's more strict. If you don't catch, programm stops.</p>

<p>The below is another story: custom exception.</p>

<pre><code class="php">try {
    # ...
    throw new Exception('Oops!');
    # ...
} catch (Exeption $e) {
    echo $e-&gt;getMessage();
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="python">try:
    # ...
    raise Exeption('Oops!')
    # ...
# Possible to multicatch, catch with out instance
# except ValueError:
except Exception as e:
    print(e.args)
</code></pre>

<h2>Module</h2>

<p>PHP includes everything into global.
In constrast, each Python file is a isolated namespace.</p>

<pre><code class="php">include 'module.php';
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="python">import module
</code></pre>

<p>PHP use include_path configuration, while Python looks for modules in following order:</p>

<ul>
<li>builtin module</li>
<li>Current script folder (eg. "module.py"). Therefore don't name your file alike any well-known libraries.</li>
<li>PYTHONPATH environtment variable</li>
<li>sys.prefix + "lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Logic</h2>

<p>PHP uses C-likes yntax logic operators.</p>

<p>Python use natural words</p>

<pre><code class="php">$x = 0
if (true || false || ! $x) {
    print("OK")
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="python">if True or False:
    print("OK")
</code></pre>

<h2>Inspect</h2>

<pre><code class="php">$today = new Date();
echo get_class($today);
print_r(get_class_methods($today))
$dynamic_class = 'Date';
$today = new $dynamic_class();
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="python">import datetime

today = datetime.date.today()
print(type(today)) # alternative: today.__class__
print(dir(today))
dynamic_class = 'datetime.date'
today = type(dynamic_class, (object,), {})
</code></pre>

<p>Python is fully OOP, that's why we have syntax like today.<strong>class</strong></p>

<h2>Context managment</h2>

<pre><code class="php">$f = fopen('test.txt', 'w');
if ($f) {
    fwrite($f, 'Test');
    fclose($f);
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="python">with open('test.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Test');
</code></pre>

<p>"with" statement is dedicated in Python to manager resource, via the object <strong>enter</strong>() and <strong>exit</strong>() function. In PHP, you have to manage it manually.</p>

<h2>Constants</h2>

<p>Python don't have constants, use var for it but in cheefully way:</p>

<pre><code class="php">const FOO = 0
const BAR = 1
const BAZ = 2
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="python">FOO, BAR, BAZ = range(3)
# Bonus:
# class Colors(object):
#    RED, GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW = (255,0,0), (0,255,0), (0,0,255), (0,255,255)
</code></pre>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>PHP is born as quick, does the job using average design language for web development.</p>

<p>Python is different, it's an art of programming:</p>

<pre><code class="no-highlight">&gt;&gt;&gt; import this
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
